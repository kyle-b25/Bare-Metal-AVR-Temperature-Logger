# Bare-Metal-AVR-Temperature-Logger
This repository contains my bare-metal AVR C project for the Arduino Uno R3. My project reads temperature data from a TMP36 analog sensor and outputs it via UART to a PC. This project has given me hands on experience in embedded C coding, ADC handling, and serial communication.
